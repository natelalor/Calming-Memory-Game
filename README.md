## Added Installations
We worked hard to provide a full front-end experience, while also encorporating a thorough backend to enhance user experience. That being said, our project is accessable via a browser, and you shouldn't need any other installations to experience our exciting memory game!

## Program Summary
Module 3 set the scene for a big project. Multiple languages, all contributing in different ways towards one goal. Through our project, we did not disappoint. Our program is a matching game, which includes an HTML, CSS, and Javascript front-end pairing nicely with our PHP and C++ back-end. Our Project uses C++ to set up the board and all of the variable's initial information, PHP to provide structure and translation to C++, Javascript to run the front-end usability & transformations while also being the secondary communications link with the back-end, and HTML & CSS to incorporate basic structure and style.

## Known Bugs
As of right now, there are a few minor bugs that are problems with our added implementations, but there is no bugs within the requirements of the project. For example, one bug is a flaw in architecture that would provide repeated output .txt files being written. While this isn't directly relevant to the criteria of the project (as well as being extremely hard to fix - Lisa agrees), small bugs like this is something that we are excited to continue to address in the future. Importantly, these bugs mentioned are not paramount to the fundamentals of the project, but instead are present within the added on features that are still very early on in development.

## Future Work
We had fun going beyond the requirements for this project. There is a lot we didn't have to do, but enjoyed implementing as a team to take this project to the next level. That being said, we still have high aspirations for this project. We would love to include a back-end for program, which would provide a more engaging leaderboard txt file at the end of the game. Or, instead of a local leaderboard, there is also the possibility of a public leaderboard, which would be able to be shared on social media platforms, to friends, and more. This idea would be a gratifying way to provide more engagement and thorough userability for our program and it's players.

## Code Citations
All of our code is written by us. The only thing we grabbed externally was the very cool gif graphic that we used as a background to our website, which you can find here: http://joyreactor.com/post/1239325
