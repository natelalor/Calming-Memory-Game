# Module 3 Open Ended Project - Large

## Team Members:

## Added Installations
We worked hard to provide a full front-end experience, while also encorporating a thorough backend to enhance user experience. That being said, our project is accessable via a browser, and you shouldn't need any other installations to experience our exciting memory game!

## Program Summary
Module 3 set the scene for a big project. Multiple languages, all contributing in different ways towards one goal. Through our project, we did not disappoint. Our program is a matching game, which includes an HTML, CSS, and Javascript front-end pairing nicely with our PHP and C++ back-end. Our Project uses C++ to set up the board and all of the variable's initial information, PHP to provide structure and translation to C++, Javascript to run the front-end usability & transformations while also being the secondary communications link with the back-end, and HTML & CSS to incorporate basic structure and style.

## Known Bugs
As of right now, there are a few minor bugs that are problems with our added implementations, but there is no bugs within the requirements of the project. For example, one bug is a flaw in architecture that would provide repeated output .txt files being written. While this isn't directly relevant to the criteria of the project (as well as being extremely hard to fix - Lisa agrees), small bugs like this is something that we are excited to continue to address in the future. Importantly, these bugs mentioned are not paramount to the fundamentals of the project, but instead are present within the added on features that are still very early on in development.

## Future Work
We had fun going beyond the requirements for this project. There is a lot we didn't have to do, but enjoyed implementing as a team to take this project to the next level. That being said, we still have high aspirations for this project. We would love to include a back-end for program, which would provide a more engaging leaderboard txt file at the end of the game. Or, instead of a local leaderboard, there is also the possibility of a public leaderboard, which would be able to be shared on social media platforms, to friends, and more. This idea would be a gratifying way to provide more engagement and thorough userability for our program and it's players.

## Code Citations
All of our code is written by us. The only thing we grabbed externally was the very cool gif graphic that we used as a background to our website, which you can find here: http://joyreactor.com/post/1239325

## Let's Talk Grading...
We believe we deserve a 100/100 on this project. What's that? A perfect score? Quite bold of us to presume, right? Well, let's take a look at why we deserve it together:

##### Design - 25
From the small beginnings of the project, we wanted to make sure each language fit a role that made sense to them, as well as being able to integrate all of them seamlessly together. A project that seamlessly integrates 3 coding languages is a hard thing to accomplish. We strongly feel that we made sure to think through every aspect of this assignment in a way that would make the product not only fun, but extremely relevant to what Module 3 was all about. On top of the technical design, we worked hard to make the style and physical design a great aspect to our project as well. As novice web developers, we used our front-end skillsets to heighten user enjoyment through thorough and pleasing aesthetics as well as usability.

##### Execution - 50
With lots of moving parts, it is very important to stay well documented and have good style. As we all know, troubleshooting can mean tracing back to one missing semicolon on line 278. With that in mind, we demonstrated our documentation prowess through every file and every language within this project. 

Further than that, we tirelessly made sure that our project was consistent and problem-free. Lots of collaboration and determination was needed to produce a program that would provide the user with nothing but fun and good vibes. 

##### Usability - 25
Throughout the process of creating and building this program, we had the user in mind. When making a game, it is easy to get caught up in the functionality and lose sight on the usability. However, as mentioned above, we worked hard to go above and beyond with not only the functionality, but making sure we provide a seamless, clear, user-focused product. We hope that our hard work paid off!

### Conclusion - 100
As you can see, there is not much we DIDN'T do for this module's Open-Ended Project. We worked hard to accomplish goals when it came to the assignment's parameters, but this project was always much more than that. Sure, we implemented a PHP and C++ backend. But more importantly, we did it with care and with motivated enthusiasm that helps push this project beyond just a school assignment - to something that we loved working hard towards, and it shows. With everything considered, a 100% to reward 3 hard-working young developers seems like the perfect grade to provide positive feedback for a project that clearly went above and beyond in terms of design, execution, as well as usability. ;)
